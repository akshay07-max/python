# Create a NumPy ndarray Object
# NumPy is used to work with arrays. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray.

# We can create a NumPy ndarray object by using the array() function.

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([11, 22, 33, 44, 55])

print(arr)          # [11 22 33 44 55]
print(type(arr))    # <class 'numpy.ndarray'>



# type(): This built-in Python function tells us the type of the object passed to it. Like in above code it shows that arr is numpy.ndarray type.
