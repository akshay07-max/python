# Properties defined inside __init__() belong to each object (instance properties).

# Properties defined outside methods belong to the class itself (class properties) and are shared by all objects:

class Person:
  species = "Human" # Class property

  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name # Instance property

p1 = Person("Emil")
p2 = Person("Tobias")

print(p1.name)
print(p2.name)
print(p1.species)
print(p2.species)
