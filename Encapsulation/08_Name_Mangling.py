# Name mangling is how Python implements private properties and methods.

# When you use double underscores __, Python automatically renames it internally by adding _ClassName in front.

# For example, __age becomes _Person__age.


class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.__age = age

p1 = Person("Emil", 30)

# This is how Python mangles the name:
print(p1._Person__age) # Not recommended!
