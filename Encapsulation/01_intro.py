# The encapsulation in python is keeping the main class data safe while accessing from the outside
# It is about the protecting the data inside a class.
# It means keeping data (properties) and methods together in a class, while controlling how the data can be accessed from outside the class.
# This prevents accidental changes to your data and hides the internal details of how your class works.
