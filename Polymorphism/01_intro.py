# The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it refers to methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.

# the length (len()) function is the good example of the polymorphism.

# len for string
str1 = "Hello World"

print(len(str1)) #returns a number of the characters present in the string.

# len for tuple
tuple1 = ("Apple", 223, 333)
print(len(tuple1))

# len for dictionary
mydict = {
    "name": "Akshay",
    "sName" : "Surase"
}

print(len(mydict))
